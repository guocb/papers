% the problem
The lack of subdirectory granularity selectivity during Git transfer (e.g.
cloning, fetching, or pushing) consumes lots of time and network bandwidth.
% why interesting
This limitation decreases users experience and reduces development efficiency
against
large enterprise level Git repositories that have a long history and huge
amounts of working files.
% solution
To support bidirectional transferring from a remote repository by
subdirectories specified by a client, we extended the existing Git transfer
protocol to allow the subdirectories negotiation between server and client.
Based on the extended protocol, we implemented new server and client side
programs to optimize Git objects transferring by removing unnecessary objects
and replace them with special placeholders.
The new client side program can still maintain the data consistency of newly
created commits.
% value
The proposed solution addresses the pain-point of working with large Git
repositories, helps the transition from legacy version control system to
Git and
boosts the adoption of Git at large enterprises.
